This project started in 2017/7, We adopt python(both of 2.7ver. and 3.5ver.) + Tensorflow + Keras

After 2015, as the Deep learnig developing rapidly, auto-modulation classification(AMC) domain is filled with new power. Rather than using expert features, researchers focus on deep neural network like CNN, whose inputs can be the raw sequences. Hance this project continues this mainstream to do some research on deep learning in AMC

Our scheme consists of 2 parts,  denoising and classification.
